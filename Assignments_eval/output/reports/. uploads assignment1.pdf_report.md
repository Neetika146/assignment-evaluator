- Key Strengths (3
- 5 points)
- Identifies the Greenhouse Effect:
- "The greenhouse effect is when gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun."
- Connects Fossil Fuels to Pollution:
- "Burning coal and oil makes pollution, and this pollution traps heat."
- Recognizes Renewable Energy as a Solution:
- "We can also use renewable energy like solar and wind power... These are better than coal and oil because they don't make as much pollution."
- Acknowledges the Role of Government:
- "Governments need to make rules to help. They can make companies pollute less."
