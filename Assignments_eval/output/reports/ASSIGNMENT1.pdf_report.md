## Specific Feedback
**: The student has a good starting point but needs to delve deeper into the nuances of economic theory and practice. While the assignment touches on several important concepts, the explanations are often superficial. Focus on understanding the *why* behind economic phenomena, not just the *what*. For example, instead of just stating that inflation is bad, explore the causes and consequences of inflation.
